One day moring me and my friend abhijeet cycled to Varsoa beach. While we were chilling out we saw an island(madh) in front of us and instantly planned to go there.

We opened Google-Maps and planned everything to reach there. There is a shortcut which you can take to reach quickly.

* reach varsoa village jetty
* take boat - 3rs per person/cycle for madh-island jetty.
* reach madh-island jetty in 3min.
* take bus for Madh Island.

But, we planned something else.

# Andheri Highway Flyover to Andheri-Versoa linking road.

A one fine Saturday morning at around 6:30am,  [Priyanka](/), [Me](http://www.ashishtiwari.me/) and [Abhijeet](https://www.facebook.com/abhijeet.ydv) took our cycles with us and met at a point. We thought of going to a different place where we haven't been before for cycling. And then suddenly one of us  said "lets go to madh island via marve beach". On hearing this we just saw at each other, smiled and what happened next was searching route to reach there, optimization of routes, after a 10min route discussion.

We three bikers started our biking session from,

* Andheri east - western express highway- Sagar hotel.
* Took a road from regency in Andheri east, came out on Andheri west highway road.
* Took a straight road of Andheri west highway connecting to link road.

It was a soothing atmosphere. Already it has rained at 5:30am in the morning. The smell of the soil was so soothing. As it was Saturday morning 7am there were hardly vehicle on the road. It was so cloudly that gave us doubt that it would rain now while cycling. Like this riding and indicating directions to each other.

# Andheri-Jogeshwari-Goregaon-Malad link road

We passed Andheri, Jogeshwari, Goregaon.
Priyanka stopped at a point she said, *"
It so hard to paddle this long. Sometimes the legs become numb.* We took a short break near **Infinity Mall**. But there was a quest of reaching to the destination that we kept going we three of us. Halting taking selfies, taking few sip of water, motivating each other we kept moving.  

We again checked how much is left and it was just half hour more. We were so near and we were so excited. we again paddled to rush to the place.

# Malvani To Marve Beach
We took a turn to Malavani Road. The road was so bad, full of pothholes, Bumping.

Somehow we entered a road which looked so amazing and smooth. Trees on both the side. Here **we reached marve beach** the first in the line of **Aksa beach** and **Mud island jetty**. We took a look at the serene beauty. There were boats from marve taking people to other side ( Manori Jetty ). We could also see a golden top of a temple which we came to know is the Vipassana Temple. We also understood that on that side is the gorai creek and nearby is the essel world.

The three of us have not had breakfast before we left home. And this was the first destination that we reached from where we were very near to our final stop "Madh Island". We had a breakfast there, idli, vada and a hot tea made us refreshing.

# Marve Beach To Aksa Beach
Thereon we took our cycles and moved further. Again a beautiful road. We saw there **Sathya Sai Institute of biotechnology**. As we moved further, we found many road-board stating its a land of indian coastal land. Further we also saw camps of INS Hamla.
Then what we saw next was a serene beauty. A road full of trees on both the sides. It was such that from both the sides trees are growing and they are getting merged in the middle creating a roof along the entire road. Passing by that route, we reached aksa beach.

All of us threw our cycle on sand and rushed to wet ourself in the water. There were very few people on the beaches.  We were playing in the water, taking pictures. Then we sat on the beach and enjoyed listening to the waves, the cool air and the calm surrounding. We complimented this setup with a refreshing nariyal pani.

# Aksa Beach to Madh Island and Madh Island Jetty
And with that we moved further to **Madh Island Jetty**. Again the route from aksa beach ro the madh island jetty was amazing and protected by natural roof provided by trees on both the side. Passing by this we finally reached the last point Madh Island Jetty.

# Madh Island Jetty to Versoa Village
We took a boat there, put our cycles on the boat costing Rs.3 per person/cycle. Within 5mins of journey on the boat we reached Versova Village. Again we boarded our cycles from the boat and began our journey back to home I.e Andheri east western express highway where we started.

# Versoa Village to Andheri ( via 4-bunglow road )
The return journey from versova was quite hectic and hot. It was around 11:15am, the cloudy weather which we enjoyed in the morning has changed to bright sunlight, sucking our energy and making us more tired.
Finally after a rigorous cycling of 3-4hrs we reached our respective homes by 12:30pm.

Scorched, tired with countless happiness. The amazing cycling session from Andheri to Madh Island and back to Andheri came to an end with good memories and amazing experience to be cherished in our lives.


Yay!! I reached home.

:( Now I've to go to office due to an E-Mail which was sent by **Project Manager** 2days back.

# WHAT IS NEXT PLAN ??

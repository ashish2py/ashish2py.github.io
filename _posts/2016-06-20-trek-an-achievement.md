**Trek** - A concept which holds different meaning for different people. For some its a way of meeting new people. A way of connectivity sometimes people of same mind frame meet here which either bond them as a professional partner or a life partner or a Friend for life. If not friend, its remembered as a trek experience which always resides in the persons memory.

For some, its a way of fighting with their own weakness and overcoming them. Trek motivates them to move forward, take the challenge, go ahead against the gravity and ascend. Though for that time the notion is to move forward and reach the top. But it changes your mindset of life.

For some, its a feeling of **conquership**. just imagine how [shivaji maharaj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivaji) have conquered these [sahyadri forts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivaji%27s_forts), the idea of making way out of way which is not at all possible to think. Some go for trek just to get the feel of conquership. Obviously, climbing the mountain for so many hours and reaching the top, its a great feel. Conquered this, not really but atleast mentally. Being so many forts in sahyadri itself, trekking them all is a big achievement of life.

Forts being at such a great height, the place is extremely away from the city's crowd and pollution. hence a good place to calm your mind giving you a peaceful atmosphere, so much greenary around makes your soul feel in heaven. Those red soil, gives you a natural manicure. The feel of the soil itself is so good. you go through woods, see so many creatures of different kind. Enjoy the waterfall. Ponds, cisterns full of water and so clean to drink.

You get to listen to so many sounds of birds and creatures. You get to see birds of different kind. Villages people who are so humble, always ready to guide and help. In crisis, they even take care of your health and feed you. The food is so delicious, a simple home made indian food. Just lovely feeling again.

The journey from base of the fort to the top and again coming back to base itself is amazing. A complete package explaining different concept of life. While ascending, our heartbeat increases, legs become numb, thirst that never goes.. All these feelings just vanishes when you reach top of the mountain.

A 360 degree view of the mountain ranges, wind moving around us, drizzles  and fog during monsoon, even a walk in the cloud, a feeling of freedom, what more do you want in your life than this feeling. All the pain, thirst goes away and we became one with the nature. what more do we want.

This feeling resides such a deep in hearts, that the thirst for nature never goes and again we are back to it in the form of next trek, same or new fort, sahyadri or himachal or any.

Overall any experience that we get from trek is an achievement in some or the other form and hence we are attracted to it so much that we want to do it again and again.

# Be positive. Be enthusiastic. Keep trekking. Keep achieving.
